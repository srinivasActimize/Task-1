        <p style="text-align:left;"> HI... share market is necessary thing that everybody has to learn. It will guide us to get financial freedom.
             A stock market, equity market, or share market is the aggregation of buyers and sellers of stocks (also called shares),
             which represent ownership claims on businesses;
             these may include securities listed on a public stock exchange as well as stock that is only traded privately,
             such as shares of private companies that are sold to investors through equity crowdfunding platforms. 
             Investments are usually made with an investment strategy in mind.
Depending on their market valuation, companies are known as large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap. It is a measure that gives investors an idea of the company’s size. Investors need a clear picture of a company’s market capitalisation to make informed investment decisions. Mid-cap companies, as their name suggests, are middle size organisations based on their market value, between large-cap and small-cap. On the stock exchanges, these companies are listed from 101-250, after large-cap companies. Investors invest in mid-cap stocks for above-market returns. But should you buy mid-cap stocks? To find the answer, we need a detailed understanding of ‘what are mid-cap stocks?’ and if they suit your investor’s profile.
